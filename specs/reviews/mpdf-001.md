# Review record — mpdf-001 (`specs/md_to_pdf_pipeline_spec.md`)

Append-only. One heading per round, newest first.

### Round 2 — 2026-08-08 — same reviewer, resumed with the author's changelog — **READY**

Verdict: `READY`, zero blocking findings. The reviewer verified every fix
against the file, not the changelog. All five round-1 blockers confirmed
resolved; all seven non-blocking fixes spot-checked and confirmed landed. The
consistency re-sweep re-derived the literals: the column default (`2`) is
stated in four places and agrees in all; the gate fixtures are consistent with
the schema and the error policy; the frontmatter, `specs/INDEX.md`, and the
derived rollup agree. Two observations, recorded as non-blocking and needing no
spec change: the escape list is non-exhaustive by design ("including"), so the
golden files pin the implementer's choice for the rest; and whether Phase 1's
strip-and-warn writes to stderr from `core` or through `cli` is left to the
implementer, which the gates do not test.

On this convergence: `status: accepted`; `reviewed: 2026-08-08` on Phase 1 and
Phase 2 — the document-wide round covered both.

### Round 1 — 2026-08-08 — fresh clean-room reviewer with repo access — **NOT READY**

Round 0 (once for this document-wide episode): both phases produce the
observable — Phase 1 a PDF from one markdown file through the CLI, Phase 2 the
same PDF with the frontmatter-controlled article look. The answer was yes; the
episode proceeded.

Verdict: `NOT READY` — five blocking findings, six non-blocking. The author
accepted all eleven, rejected none, deferred none.

Blockers, and how each was resolved:

1. **OQ-2 (font sourcing) unresolved, blocked Phase 1** — the gate was not
   reproducible while the font source was open. Resolved as a recorded
   decision: fonts bundled and embedded at compile time (`core/assets/fonts/`),
   default family Libertinus Serif (OFL), no OS discovery on any target.
2. **OQ-1 (Typst crate list and `World` shape) unresolved, blocked Phase 1** —
   the spec deferred its own research to "this phase's review", which was this
   round. Resolved: `typst` + `typst-pdf`, versions pinned at implementation;
   the `World` supplies the standard library, font book, main source,
   `template.typ` bytes, bundled fonts, and current date.
3. **OQ-3 (frontmatter schema) unresolved, blocked Phase 2** — the §1 example
   read as provisional, and missing-key behavior was undefined. Resolved:
   `title`/`author` optional strings, `columns` `1|2` default `2`, absent
   frontmatter valid, unknown key or invalid `columns` an error naming the
   key. Gate fixtures pinned: the default fixture omits `columns`.
4. **Escaping of Typst-significant characters unspecified** — `$5` would open
   math mode; a friendly fixture would pass for the wrong reason. Resolved: a
   normative escape rule in §2, plus a hostile-fixture gate case whose golden
   file shows each listed character escaped.
5. **Out-of-dialect construct policy undefined** — two implementers would ship
   observably different tools. Resolved: a recorded decision — an unsupported
   construct is an error; the CLI exits non-zero naming the construct and its
   line — plus a bullet-list gate case.

Non-blocking, all accepted: Phase 1 strips and warns on a leading frontmatter
block, and Phase 2 removes that behavior; the two `core` functions are named
(`md_to_typst`, `md_to_pdf`); both close-outs name complete rule `sources` and
all five §8.1 keys; `--emit-typst` output declared inspection-only; the network
fetch attributed to the embedder's package-resolution glue, never the compiler;
the CLI contract pinned (`-o` optional, `.pdf`-substitution default, stderr,
exit code 1); heading levels 1–6 map to Typst headings of the same level.

Rejections: none.
