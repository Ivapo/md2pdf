  Typst's own web app is the inspiration for the two-pane shape and for
  re-rendering as you type. Its collaboration, its package registry and its
  server are all out of scope permanently: this app runs on the local machine
  and fetches nothing, per mpdf-001 §2.

# desktop app

## 1. Goal

Show the PDF while you write it. **The observable is unchanged from `mpdf-001`
— the typeset PDF that Typst compiles from the user's markdown — but it stops
being a file you open and becomes a page you watch.** The consumer is the same
author, who today runs a command, switches to a viewer, reads a page, switches
back, and repeats that loop on every edit.

What Phase 1 alone produces:

```console
$ cargo tauri dev            # a window opens
```

Open `samples/article.md` from the window's Open dialog, and its page is drawn:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ samples/article.md                     │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│          A Sample Article              │
│               Iva Po                   │
│                                        │
│  Introduction                          │
│  This file exists so you can see…      │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Phase 2 makes that page redraw on every save, which is what turns it from a
viewer into a loop. Phase 3 adds the status the loop needs to show — stale,
failed, and how long the compile took — and an export. Phase 4 adds a text pane
on the left, and the app becomes the editor too; that phase is last because it
is the only one the project can do without.

The engine does not change. `md2pdf-core` already takes a markdown string and
returns PDF bytes, and `mpdf-001` §1 recorded the claim this spec is the test
of: "A Tauri desktop app later becomes a second thin wrapper around the same
core crate. It is not a rewrite."

### 1.1 Non-goals

- **No servers, no network. Ever.** `mpdf-001` §2's decision is inherited
  whole. The app fetches nothing at run time, and any asset it needs is
  bundled at build time.
- **No change to the dialect.** The app converts exactly what `mpdf-001` and
  `mpdf-002` accept, and refuses exactly what they refuse, with the same
  message. A construct the CLI names is a construct this app names.
- **macOS only.** Windows and Linux are future work. Nothing in `core` is
  platform-specific, so a later port is a packaging job rather than a rewrite,
  and saying that here is what keeps this spec from designing for three
  platforms it cannot test.
- **Not the browser build.** `mpdf-001` §1.1 parks a `wasm32` build, and it
  stays parked. It is a different front end with a different file story, so it
  is a later spec rather than a phase here.
- Out of scope, parked: multi-file projects and manifests, a document library
  or recent-files list, printing, PDF export options, theming, collaboration,
  and anything agentic.

## 2. Design

A third crate joins the workspace beside `core` and `cli`:

- **`app`** — a Tauri binary. It owns file I/O, the window, and the watch loop.
- It calls `md2pdf-core` and nothing else of the project's own code.

`core` gains nothing and changes nothing. That is the falsifiable claim: if
building this app requires an edit to `core/src/lib.rs` beyond what a bug fix
would need, `mpdf-001` §1's "not a rewrite" was wrong, and the review round
should say so rather than let the edit through quietly. Round 1 confirmed the
claim holds for Phase 1: `md_to_pdf`, `image_paths`, `Asset`, `ImageRef` and
`Error` are already public at the crate root, and Phase 1 needs nothing else.

### Why a third crate, not a mode of the CLI (decision, recorded)

`cli` is a binary with a contract — arguments, exit codes, stderr — that
`cli/tests/cli_test.rs` pins. A window has none of those, and a GUI subcommand
would put a webview dependency into every CLI build. Two binaries over one
library is the shape `mpdf-001` §2 already drew, and this is the second one it
predicted.

### Why the app owns file I/O, exactly as the CLI does (decision, recorded)

`core` holds no OS access by design, so the app reads files itself. It mirrors
`cli/src/main.rs:read_assets`: call `md2pdf_core::image_paths` on the markdown,
resolve each path against the document's parent directory, read the bytes once
per path, and hand back `Asset` values that keep the path the markdown wrote.
Duplicating that logic in a second wrapper is deliberate and small — the
alternative is a shared helper crate for forty lines, and the two wrappers
report errors differently, which is most of what those forty lines do.

### Why the preview shows the PDF itself (decision, recorded)

The pane draws the artifact, not a picture of it. Typst's layout engine decides
the page breaks and produces page frames, and both `typst-pdf` and Typst's SVG
export consume those same frames — so pagination, glyph positions and line
breaking are identical whichever one draws the pane. What differs is everything
the PDF format carries besides the picture: a link is a live annotation rather
than dead ink, text can be selected and searched, and the accessibility tagging
that `mpdf-001`'s OQ-6 put on `table.header` is present. The sharpest reason is
the last: `typst-pdf` is a separate crate from the layout engine, so a pane
drawn from frames would show that the *layout* is right, which is not the claim
this project makes. The observable is the PDF.

The constraint that rides with it: **no bundled JavaScript PDF viewer.** This
project has no dependency of that kind and does not gain one for a preview
pane. OQ-1's probe settled that it does not have to: WebKit draws the PDF
itself, and the mechanism is recorded below.

### Why the pane is a `blob:` URL in an iframe (decision, recorded)

The app hands the compiled bytes to the page, the page wraps them in a `Blob`
with type `application/pdf`, and an iframe's `src` is the object URL. WebKit
then instantiates its own PDF document view inside that frame. OQ-1's probe
confirmed each step on this machine, and two properties of this route decided
it over the alternatives.

The first is that it is same-origin. A blob URL inherits the page's origin —
the probe read `blob:tauri://localhost/…` — so the parent page can reach into
the frame, which a custom URI scheme does not allow: the probe found that same
frame served over a `pdf://` scheme loads but exposes a `null`
`contentDocument`, because the scheme is a separate origin. Everything the
later phases need from the frame — the scroll offset OQ-3 is about above all —
is reachable only on the same-origin route.

The second is that the bytes never touch the disk. A temporary file would put
the artifact somewhere the user did not ask for, and would need cleaning up on
a crash.

**The escape hatch, if WebKit ever stops doing this.** The probe was run on one
macOS version, and §1.1 keeps this spec to macOS, so the risk is bounded — but
it is not zero, and a later WebKit or a later platform could take the native
PDF view away. The fallback is then Typst's SVG export, one page per frame,
which is already reachable: `typst-svg` 0.15.1 sits in `Cargo.lock` today as a
transitive dependency of `typst`. Taking it would mean amending this decision
and saying so, because the pane would stop showing the artifact and start
showing a picture of it. It would not mean bundling a JavaScript viewer, which
stays refused either way.

### Why the watch set is the document plus every image it names (decision, recorded)

A document that changes is not the only thing that should redraw the page. A
figure edited in another program should redraw it too, and `mpdf-002` already
supplies the list: `md2pdf_core::image_paths` returns every path the document
names, in reader order. Emission reads no image bytes, so that list is
available even when the document names a file that does not exist yet, which
is what makes the watch set computable from a document that will not compile.

### Why a change is a whole re-compile (decision, recorded)

No incremental machinery, no caching, no partial re-layout. Measured on this
machine on 2026-08-10, twenty runs of the release binary each, medians:
`samples/press-release.md` 8.5 ms and `samples/article.md` 28.7 ms, both
including the process spawn that the app does not pay. A re-render per save is
affordable by two orders of magnitude, and an incremental path would be a large
amount of state to hold wrong. If a document is ever slow enough to need one,
that is a measurement and a later phase, not a guess made now.

The numbers are stated with their method because a first pass took one run each
and reported 42 ms for the article, which round 1 could not reproduce; a single
cold run is not a measurement.

### Why the last good page survives an error (decision, recorded)

An author mid-edit passes through broken states constantly — a half-typed
table, a fence not yet closed. Blanking the pane on each one loses their place
and makes the loop worse than the CLI it replaces. So a failed compile leaves
the last page drawn and shows the error above it, in the same words the CLI
prints: the construct and its line, or the frontmatter key and its line. The
pane also marks itself stale, because a page that silently belongs to older
text would be the flattening `mpdf-001` §2 refuses, one layer up.

### Why the app's logic lives in plain functions (decision, recorded)

Everything that can be decided without a window — the watch set, the debounce,
the asset read, the error string, the stale flag — lives in ordinary Rust
functions with ordinary tests. Only the parts that genuinely need a window go
through Tauri's command layer. A GUI whose logic is reachable only by clicking
has no exit gate but a screenshot.

This rule is about where logic lives, and it does not claim that every gate in
this spec is a test. One thing genuinely cannot be one: whether the right
pixels reached the glass. That claim is read by a person, exactly as
`mpdf-001`'s Phases 7 and 9 read a PDF by eye. The rule's job is to keep that
list to one item.

## 3. Open questions

- **OQ-1** — ~~how does the pane draw a compiled PDF, and can it be done with no
  bundled viewer? On macOS the window is a WKWebView, which renders PDFs
  natively, but the mechanics are unverified: whether bytes can be handed over
  through a custom protocol, a `blob:` URL or a temporary file; whether an
  `<embed>` or `<iframe>` draws it or only a full-frame navigation does; and
  what the app can control about the viewer's own chrome, zoom and scroll
  position. If no route holds, the fallback is Typst's SVG export per page,
  and §2's decision is amended to record why the artifact could not be shown
  directly. Answerable from code and a probe during review. Blocks Phase 1's
  gate case (1), and OQ-3 depends on the answer.~~ **RESOLVED (2026-08-10), in
  review round 1: a `blob:` URL in an iframe, and no bundled viewer.** A
  throwaway Tauri 2.11.5 app was built and run on macOS 26.5.2, and it
  reported, from inside the webview: `navigator.pdfViewerEnabled` is `true`,
  `navigator.mimeTypes['application/pdf']` is present, and the frame fed a blob
  of the compiled bytes exposes a `contentDocument` whose `contentType` is
  `application/pdf`, whose location is `blob:tauri://localhost/…`, and which
  holds one `<embed>` — WebKit's own PDF document view, built without anything
  the app shipped. Custom-scheme serving also works — a `pdf://` scheme
  returned 200 with the right content type — but that frame's
  `contentDocument` is `null`, because the scheme is a separate origin, which
  is what ruled it out. Landed in §2 as its own decision.

  The residual, recorded rather than hidden: the probe proves WebKit
  *instantiated* its PDF view, not that the pixels are right. Nothing readable
  from JavaScript can prove that, and this machine denies the terminal
  Screen Recording permission, so no screenshot could be taken during the
  round. Phase 1's gate case (1) therefore has to be run where a human can see
  the window, and it says so.
- **OQ-2** — ~~which Tauri version, and what does the minimal app look like in
  code — the crate layout, the configuration file, the command boundary, and
  what the workspace must carry for `cargo tauri dev` to open a window?
  `mpdf-001`'s OQ-1 is the precedent: the same question about the Typst crates
  was answered by reading them during review. Answerable from code during
  review. Blocks Phase 1.~~ **RESOLVED (2026-08-10), in review round 1**, by
  building the throwaway app rather than by reading about it. Tauri 2 —
  `tauri` 2.11.5 and `tauri-build` 2.6.3 resolve today, and `tauri-cli` 2.10.1
  is what runs `cargo tauri dev`; the versions pin at implementation, as
  `mpdf-001` §2 pinned the Typst crates. The crate is seven files: `Cargo.toml`
  naming `tauri` and `tauri-plugin-dialog` with `tauri-build` under
  `[build-dependencies]`; `build.rs` calling `tauri_build::build()`;
  `tauri.conf.json` with `identifier`, `build.frontendDist` and an
  `app.windows` entry; `src/main.rs`; `dist/index.html`; `icons/icon.png`; and
  `capabilities/default.json`.

  Four facts cost a build each and are recorded so the next reader does not pay
  again. `icons/icon.png` is **required** — without it `generate_context!`
  panics at compile time with "failed to open icon", which is a confusing
  failure for a window that has no icon yet. `app.withGlobalTauri: true` puts
  the API on `window.__TAURI__`, so **the frontend needs no bundler and no npm
  toolchain at all** — `frontendDist` is a directory of static files, which
  keeps the whole app one Cargo build. The command boundary is
  `#[tauri::command]` plus `generate_handler!`, and a custom URI scheme is
  `register_uri_scheme_protocol`. And the Open dialog is
  `tauri-plugin-dialog`, which needs `dialog:allow-open` in
  `capabilities/default.json` beside `core:default`; the probe called it and
  the native dialog opened rather than rejecting, which is what confirms the
  permission entry is right.
- **OQ-3** — what holds the scroll position across a re-render? A watch loop
  that returns the reader to page 1 on every save is unusable for a document
  longer than a page, and it is the difference between this app and a shell
  loop that reopens a viewer. OQ-1's resolution is what leaves the question
  answerable at all — the blob frame is same-origin, so the parent can read and
  write inside it, where the custom-scheme frame it ruled out could not be
  touched. What remains open is what WebKit's own PDF view exposes to be saved
  and restored, and the honest floor may be an offset rather than a semantic
  position. Design call, with the mechanism answerable from code. Blocks
  Phase 2's gate case (2).
- **OQ-4** — can the watcher follow a path that does not exist yet? A document
  may name `figures/new.svg` minutes before that file is created, and the
  watch set includes it because `image_paths` reads the text rather than the
  disk. The usual answer is to watch the parent directory instead of the file,
  which changes what a change event means and how much the loop filters.
  Answerable from code (the file-watching crate the phase picks). Blocks
  Phase 2's scope.
- **OQ-5** — what does the editor phase do when the file changes on disk while
  the text pane holds unsaved edits? Every editor answers this and none of the
  answers is free: refuse the reload, take the disk copy, or ask. It does not
  block anything until Phase 4, and stating it here is what stops Phase 4 being
  designed as if the question were not there. Design call. Blocks Phase 4.

## 4. Implementation phases

Strictly sequential; each is one plan-mode pass. Phases 1 to 3 build a
previewer, which is usable on its own. Phase 4 makes it an editor, and it is
the one phase this spec could lose without invalidating the rest.

### Phase 1 — the window, and one compile on screen
*Produces the observable: yes — the typeset PDF, on screen, from a document
the user picked.*

- **Scope:** Add the `app` crate to the workspace — package `md2pdf-app`,
  binary `md2pdf-app`, the seven files OQ-2 lists, `members` in the root
  `Cargo.toml` gaining `"app"`. An Open dialog through `tauri-plugin-dialog`,
  filtered to `md`, with the capability entry OQ-2 names; the app opens one
  file at a time. On open, in plain functions per §2: read the document, read
  its assets the way `cli/src/main.rs:read_assets` does, call
  `md2pdf_core::md_to_pdf`, and hand the bytes to the page, which draws them
  per §2's blob decision. The bytes cross the boundary as `tauri::ipc::Response`
  rather than as a returned `Vec<u8>`, which would serialize as a JSON array of
  numbers — a performance choice rather than a correctness one, named here so
  it is not rediscovered. The window titles the open document. No watching, no
  editing, no export, no status chrome — Phases 2 and 3 own those.

  Two failure classes reach the pane, and they are not the same type. A
  compile failure is a `md2pdf_core::Error`, and the pane draws its `Display`
  — the same text the CLI prints after its `error: ` prefix. A file that will
  not read is not an `Error` at all: `cli/src/main.rs:read_assets` builds a
  plain `String` for it, and this app builds the same sentence for the same
  case, so a missing figure names the path and the line here exactly as it does
  at the terminal. Either way the pane shows the message and the app stays
  open. Neither keeps a previous page, because Phase 1 has none to keep.
- **Exit gate:** (1) Opening `samples/article.md` draws its first page, and
  opening `samples/press-release.md` draws its first page in the second look.
  **This case is read by eye by a person at the window** — the precedent is
  `mpdf-001`'s Phases 7 and 9, which read a PDF by eye for a claim no test
  could hold; Phase 6 of that spec faced the same problem and chose a textual
  assertion instead, which is available there and is not here. OQ-1's residual
  is why: nothing readable from JavaScript proves the pixels, and the machine
  this spec was drafted on denies the screenshot. (2) Opening
  `tests/fixtures/unsupported_html.md` draws the message naming the construct
  and line 5, and the app stays open — the same rejection the CLI makes, at a
  third level. (3) Unit tests over the plain functions, three cases, each with
  the directory it needs, because one fixture cannot carry all three: with
  `dot.png` and `figures/mark.svg` both present beside a copy of
  `tests/fixtures/figure.md`, the reader returns two `Asset` values; with
  `figures/` absent — which is how `tests/fixtures/` actually stands — it
  reports `figures/mark.svg` by path and by line 5; and over an inline document
  naming `dot.png` twice, in a directory holding that one file, it returns one
  `Asset` and reads the file once. The last case takes an inline document
  rather than a fixture: `images.md` repeats `dot.png` on lines 3 and 10, but
  names `fig#2.png` on line 7, which no directory holds, so a reader fails
  there before it ever reaches the repeat. (4) `cargo test --workspace`
  still passes and `core` and `cli` are untouched, which is §2's falsifiable
  claim checked as a diff.
- **Close-out:** Seed `rules/desktop.md` with all five frontmatter keys the
  methodology's §8.1 requires, `sources` naming the new crate's files. The
  README gains a section for the app. One push.

### Phase 2 — the watch loop
*Produces the observable: yes — the same PDF, redrawn on every save, which is
the whole point of the app.*

- **Scope:** Watch the document and every path `md2pdf_core::image_paths`
  returns, per §2, with OQ-4's answer deciding whether the watcher takes the
  files or their directories. Recompute the watch set after every successful
  parse, because an edit may add or drop an image. Debounce, because one save
  arrives as several filesystem events; the interval is a constant with its
  measurement beside it, not a guess. On each settled change: re-read,
  re-compile, redraw. A failed compile keeps the last good page and shows the
  error above it, and marks the pane stale, per §2.
- **Exit gate:** (1) Editing `samples/article.md` and saving redraws the page
  without any action in the window; verified by hand once and recorded. (2) The
  scroll position survives a re-render, per OQ-3's resolution. (3) Unit tests
  over the plain functions: the watch set for `tests/fixtures/figure.md` holds
  the document and both image paths; two events inside the debounce window
  produce one compile and two outside produce two; a compile error leaves the
  previous page as the current one and sets the stale flag. (4) Replacing an
  image file on disk, with the document untouched, redraws the page.
- **Close-out:** Update `rules/desktop.md` against the code. One push.

### Phase 3 — export, and the state the loop needs to show
*Produces the observable: yes — the PDF written to a file the user names,
which is the artifact the CLI writes.*

- **Scope:** A Save-a-copy command that writes the current PDF bytes where the
  user asks, defaulting to the document's path with a `.pdf` extension, which
  is `cli/src/main.rs:default_output`'s rule. The window shows what the loop
  knows: the open document, whether the page is current or stale, the compile
  time, and the error when there is one. Nothing here re-compiles — export
  writes the bytes the pane is already showing, so the file and the page cannot
  disagree.
- **Exit gate:** (1) Export writes a file starting with the `%PDF` magic bytes,
  byte-identical to what `md2pdf <the same document>` writes — the two wrappers
  agree, which is the claim that keeps the app honest. (2) Export is refused,
  with a message, while the pane is stale. (3) Unit tests over the default
  output path and the state machine that decides current, stale and failed.
- **Close-out:** Update `rules/desktop.md` and the README against the code.
  One push.

### Phase 4 — the text pane
*Produces the observable: yes — the same PDF, redrawn as the author types
rather than as they save.*

- **Scope:** A text pane beside the preview. It holds the document's text,
  writes it to disk on save, and re-renders on a debounce as it changes. The
  external-change rule follows OQ-5's resolution. The pane is a plain text
  editor, not a rich one: no syntax highlighting, no autocomplete, no
  formatting commands. Those are a later phase or a later spec, and naming
  them here is what stops this one growing into an editor project.
- **Exit gate:** (1) Typing in the pane redraws the preview without a save; the
  debounce holds it to one compile per pause. (2) Save writes the file, and the
  watch loop does not then compile the same text a second time. (3) The
  external-change rule behaves as OQ-5 resolved, tested at the plain-function
  level. (4) A document opened, edited, saved and reopened round-trips byte for
  byte.
- **Close-out:** Update `rules/desktop.md` and the README against the code.
  One push.

### Phase 5 — an app you can install
*Produces the observable: yes — the same PDF, from an app launched from the
Applications folder rather than from a build command.*

- **Scope:** A macOS bundle: an `.app` with its icon, its identifier and its
  document association for `.md`, and a `.dmg` to carry it. Signing and
  notarisation if the phase can be run with credentials to hand; if it cannot,
  the phase ships the unsigned bundle and names the gap rather than pretending
  to close it.
- **Exit gate:** (1) The built `.app` launches on a machine that has no Rust
  toolchain and no fonts installed, opens `samples/article.md`, and draws the
  page — which is also the last check that the bundled fonts really are
  bundled. (2) Opening a `.md` file from Finder launches the app on that
  document. (3) The build is one documented command.
- **Close-out:** Update `rules/desktop.md` and the README's install section
  against the code. One push.
